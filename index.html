            <h1>From Student to Developer <span class="highlight">My Journey into Software Engineering and The Maze Project</span>.</h1>
            <p> My name is Youssef Ahmed, I’m 20 years old, and I’m currently in my 3rd year at Technology University in Egypt. Over a year ago, I embarked on a life-changing journey by enrolling in the ALX Software Engineering track. Before that, I knew I had a passion for technology but wasn't sure what direction to take. ALX helped me discover that passion for software development, specifically back-end programming.
                
                The path wasn't always easy. In the early days, I spent countless hours debugging code, fixing syntax errors, and learning the intricacies of algorithms. But as I progressed, the satisfaction of solving complex problems made the hard work worthwhile. One of the defining projects I’ve worked on is The Maze Project, which introduced me to the world of graphics programming and game design using SDL2 and raycasting. While challenging, this project helped sharpen my problem-solving skills and strengthened my desire to pursue back-end development.
                
                Through my journey with ALX, I’ve fallen in love with the process of building reliable, scalable systems that power the core of applications. My goal is to become a back-end software engineer for a large company, where I can contribute to impactful projects and continue growing as a developer.
                
                The journey has had its ups and downs, but with each new challenge, I become more confident and excited about the future. I know there's still so much to learn, but I’m committed to making my dream a reality.
